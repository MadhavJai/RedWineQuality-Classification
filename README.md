# RedWineQuality-Classification

The purpose of this project is to use pyCaret to find the best classifier model to predict wine quality of the red wine dataset. From this project, the top 3 classifiers as ranked by pyCaret were chosen and models were created of them (random forest, extra trees and light gradient boosting machine classifier). Each of those models were also tuned. The tuned random forest model was singled out as it was determined to be the best one. It was used to plot models, predict on a subset of samples called the unseen samples. Finally the tuned random forest model was then saved locally for future use.
